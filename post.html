        <h2>Example Blog Websites</h2>
        <p>
            Here, we'll provide you with some examples of the final look of the blog website you will build as part of
            your project. Note that these use placeholder text, which you will also be allowed to utilize in the project
            instead of needing to type out all of your own blog posts (although you are certainly encouraged to do so!).
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that while these examples include most, if not all, of the requirements under the project rubric, the
            exact layout and styling is completely up to you. The bottom of the rubric contains some extra ways to stand
            out, but customizing the layout & styling of your blog website is a great way to create a unique website of
            your own regardless.
